when the code terminated game screen must shown then just follow numbers and enter them in textbox.
if numbers ,that you entered, configuration is true then continue to follow numbers in next level

Numbers input have to be like this:
numbernumbernumbernumbernumber(Enter)
12345

when gamer forgot the true combination of numbers,s/he need to enter Y or N . if enter Y game will restart , if not game will shot down.


have a nice day, take care.
